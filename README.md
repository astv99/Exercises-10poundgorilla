**Instructions**

> **Mini HTML Mockup**

> Code the code-this.png mockup in HTML and CSS utilizing Bootstrap’s framework as much as possible.

> The file structure and images are all set up and ready to go. All you need to do is code it. The layout.css has a commented out section at the top that list the colors, font sizes, and font weights used.

> Don’t worry about matching paddings or margins to the markup. Just use Bootstrap's default styling for things like margins and paddings on columns and font tags.


**Tools & Techniques**

- HTML5
- CSS3 using BEM
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
- Google Fonts


**Notes**

- Not mobile-compatible; desktop-only for laptop and desktop computers
- Cross-browser compatible with current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera, as well as Internet Explorer 11
- Eye image in the lower-right not centered on the retina of the eye as seen in the design mock-up (could not determine how to achieve proper centering without modifying the source image file)
