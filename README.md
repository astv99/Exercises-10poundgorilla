**Instructions**

> **Mini HTML Mockup**

> Code the code-this.png mockup in HTML and CSS utilizing Bootstrap’s framework as much as possible.

> The file structure and images are all set up and ready to go. All you need to do is code it. The layout.css has a commented out section at the top that list the colors, font sizes, and font weights used.

> Don’t worry about matching paddings or margins to the markup. Just use Bootstrap's default styling for things like margins and paddings on columns and font tags.
